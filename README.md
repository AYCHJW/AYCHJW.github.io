The idea behind was to create a small jewellery E-Commerce that looks like a paper catalogue so you can list the pages. 
I am not planning to implement any another updates, but it is currently in working order with finished responsive template based on bootstrap framework. It already has a solid basis to become well looking unique E-commerce for personal use to be used for another project.

<b>[<span>Installation</span>]</b><br>
1st Run the script catalog.sql into your query analyzer and press F5. Create a database if you do not have one<br>
2nd Put the website into the main directory, not in sub-folder, some files use "Directory Root" as a destination and you may have problems with images and files including<br>
3th Replace your SQL connecting credentials in the config.php (at the very bottom)<br>
<p><br> <br>
